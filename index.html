<h1>The Overview</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p></p>

<h1>Context &#38; Challenge</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
	For my final project in IDM232, or Scripting II, I focused on developing a dynamic recipe website that utilized PHP to manage and display data. 
	This assignment challenged me to expand my web development skills by transitioning from front-end design techniques to backend programming. 
	Working with a large dataset of recipes, my goal was to create a site that could handle complex information while providing a clear and organized user experience. 
	The course spanned 10 weeks under the guidance of Professor Philip Sinatra, with each assignment designed to progressively build the necessary skills for the final project. 
	This methodical structure allowed me to approach the project with focus and apply new techniques step by step.
</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>
	The project introduced me to PHP, a server-side scripting language I had never used before, which required a new approach to building websites. 
	Unlike the static methods I was familiar with, PHP allowed for dynamic content generation, but it also posed unique challenges. 
	My main task was to design a system that could efficiently retrieve and display recipe data, such as images, ingredients, and instructions, from a structured database. 
	Balancing the technical demands of learning a new language with creating a user-friendly interface required careful planning and problem-solving throughout the development process.
</p>

<h2>Goals &#38; Objectives </h2>
<p>
	The key goal for this project was to deliver a functional recipe website that could dynamically display content based on user interactions. 
	I aimed to ensure users could search, filter, and browse recipes with ease, all while maintaining a visually clean and straightforward design. 
	On the technical side, my objective was to write efficient, modular code that utilized PHP’s strengths in database integration to handle large datasets effectively. 
	This project served as an opportunity to deepen my understanding of backend development and apply these skills in a practical and creative way.
</p>


<h1>Process &#38; Insight</h1>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>
	The target audience for this project includes home cooks and food enthusiasts who prioritize simplicity, efficiency, and visual clarity when searching for recipes. 
	These users value platforms that allow them to easily discover, organize, and access cooking inspiration without unnecessary complexity. 
	Whether they are preparing meals for a busy weeknight or exploring new dishes to impress at gatherings, these individuals want a website that works seamlessly as a practical and approachable tool. 
	By understanding their preferences, I focused on designing features such as intuitive navigation, clear recipe categories, and dynamic search functionality that would make the cooking experience more enjoyable.

	
</p>

<h2>Rsearch &#38; Planning</h2>
<p>
	To ensure the design met the needs of the audience, I started by studying two popular recipe platforms: Dinnerly and The Kitchn. 
	Dinnerly stood out for its minimalistic design and user-friendly layout, which inspired my approach to creating a clean and simple interface. 
	However, I noticed some areas for improvement, such as limited dynamic functionality and a lack of visually distinct categories. T
	he Kitchn, on the other hand, offered a more content-rich experience with strong visual hierarchy and effective use of space. 
	It influenced my decision to emphasize clear navigation and visually engaging layouts.
</p>

<p>
	After analyzing these platforms, I identified what worked well and what could be improved, using these insights as the foundation for my design decisions. 
	I created wireframes to map out the structure of the website, ensuring that elements like the search bar, recipe filters, and content organization were positioned intuitively. 
	This stage helped me establish the core layout and functionality before diving into the design and development process.
</p>

<h2>Design Development</h2>
<p>
	The visual identity of the website was carefully crafted to align with the audience’s preferences for a fresh, inviting, and practical design. 
	I chose a soft cream background (#FBFDEC) to create a clean and welcoming atmosphere, while bold accent colors, like bright pinks and blues, were used strategically to highlight interactive elements such as buttons and links. 
	These colors not only drew attention to key actions but also added a sense of vibrancy to the overall design. 
	For hover effects, I incorporated contrasting colors to provide subtle yet effective feedback during user interactions.
</p>

<p>
	Typography was equally important in defining the website’s character. 
	I paired a bold serif font for headings to give the interface personality and structure, while a clean sans-serif font was selected for body text to ensure readability. 
	The type hierarchy was carefully adjusted to differentiate key elements, such as recipe titles and instructions, ensuring the content remained clear and easy to navigate.
</p>

<p>
	Throughout the design process, I made refinements based on feedback and testing. 
	Early iterations of the color palette included brighter tones, but these were adjusted to more muted shades for better accessibility. 
	Similarly, I revisited my font pairings to maintain consistency and alignment with the website’s theme. 
	These refinements helped create a cohesive, polished design that met the project’s goals.
