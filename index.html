	This methodical structure allowed me to approach the project with focus and apply new techniques step by step.
</p>
<!--section 3-->
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>
	The project introduced me to PHP, a server-side scripting language I had never used before, which required a new approach to building websites. 
	Unlike the static methods I was familiar with, PHP allowed for dynamic content generation, but it also posed unique challenges. 
	My main task was to design a system that could efficiently retrieve and display recipe data, such as images, ingredients, and instructions, from a structured database. 
	Balancing the technical demands of learning a new language with creating a user-friendly interface required careful planning and problem-solving throughout the development process.
</p>

<h1>Process &#38; Insight</h1>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>
	The target audience for this project includes home cooks and food enthusiasts who prioritize simplicity, efficiency, and visual clarity when searching for recipes. 
	These users value platforms that allow them to easily discover, organize, and access cooking inspiration without unnecessary complexity. 
	Whether they are preparing meals for a busy weeknight or exploring new dishes to impress at gatherings, these individuals want a website that works seamlessly as a practical and approachable tool. 
	By understanding their preferences, I focused on designing features such as intuitive navigation, clear recipe categories, and dynamic search functionality that would make the cooking experience more enjoyable.
</p>

<h2>Research &#38; Planning</h2>
<p>
	To ensure the design met the needs of the audience, I started by studying two popular recipe platforms: Dinnerly and The Kitchn. 
	Dinnerly stood out for its minimalistic design and user-friendly layout, which inspired my approach to creating a clean and simple interface. 
	However, I noticed some areas for improvement, such as limited dynamic functionality and a lack of visually distinct categories. T
	he Kitchn, on the other hand, offered a more content-rich experience with strong visual hierarchy and effective use of space. 
	It influenced my decision to emphasize clear navigation and visually engaging layouts.
</p>

<p>
	After analyzing these platforms, I identified what worked well and what could be improved, using these insights as the foundation for my design decisions. 
	I created wireframes to map out the structure of the website, ensuring that elements like the search bar, recipe filters, and content organization were positioned intuitively. 
	This stage helped me establish the core layout and functionality before diving into the design and development process.
</p>

<h2>Design Development</h2>
<p>
	The visual identity of the website was carefully crafted to align with the audience’s preferences for a fresh, inviting, and practical design. 
	I chose a soft cream background (#FBFDEC) to create a clean and welcoming atmosphere, while bold accent colors, like bright pinks and blues, were used strategically to highlight interactive elements such as buttons and links. 
	These colors not only drew attention to key actions but also added a sense of vibrancy to the overall design. 
	For hover effects, I incorporated contrasting colors to provide subtle yet effective feedback during user interactions.
</p>

</div>
<p>
	Typography was equally important in defining the website’s character. 
	I paired a bold serif font for headings to give the interface personality and structure, while a clean sans-serif font was selected for body text to ensure readability. 
	The type hierarchy was carefully adjusted to differentiate key elements, such as recipe titles and instructions, ensuring the content remained clear and easy to navigate.

<p>
	Throughout the design process, I made refinements based on feedback and testing. 
	Early iterations of the color palette included brighter tones, but these were adjusted to more muted shades for better accessibility. 
	Similarly, I revisited my font pairings to maintain consistency and alignment with the website’s theme. 
	These refinements helped create a cohesive, polished design that met the project’s goals.

<h1>The Solution</h1>
<h3>
	To simplify the cooking experience and address the need for a more dynamic and user-friendly recipe platform, I focused on designing and implementing several core features. 
	These included a functional search bar, a cuisine filter, a central recipe hub, individual recipe pages, and responsive design. 
	Each feature was thoughtfully developed to balance functionality with accessibility, ensuring the platform remained practical while enhancing usability.
</h3>

<h2>Search Functionality</h2>
<p>
	The search bar allows users to quickly find recipes by entering keywords. 
	For example, typing "chicken" dynamically displays all recipes that include chicken as an ingredient. 
	This feature was designed to save time and eliminate frustration by providing users with instant, relevant results. 
	It transforms the search experience into something both simple and intuitive, creating a seamless connection between user input and the content they need.
</p>

<h2>Cuisine Filter</h2>
<p>
	The cuisine filter organizes recipes into clearly defined categories, such as "Italian," "Mexican," or "Vegetarian." 
	This feature helps users narrow down their choices based on specific preferences, creating a more focused browsing experience. 
	Unlike static filters, this dynamic feature ensures that users can explore recipes by theme with ease, offering a level of personalization that enhances their interaction with the platform.
</p>

<h2>Central Recipe Hub</h2>
<p>
	The central recipe hub acts as a starting point for users who prefer to browse all available recipes. 
	This page dynamically displays the full collection of recipes in an organized, scrollable format. 
	Each recipe is represented with a thumbnail, title, and brief description, giving users a visual and textual preview before diving deeper. 
	From this hub, users can click on any recipe to access its dedicated page.
</p>

<h2>Individual Recipe Pages</h2>
<p>
	Each recipe page is dynamically generated to display all the essential details a user needs, including ingredients, cooking steps, preparation times, serving sizes, and accompanying pictures. 
	The layout is structured to prioritize clarity, ensuring users can easily follow instructions while cooking.
	 These pages were designed with simplicity in mind, reducing cognitive load and making the content approachable for cooks of all skill levels.
</p>

<h2>Responsive Design</h2>
<p>
	The platform was built to adapt seamlessly to various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
	 This ensures users can access recipes wherever they are, whether they’re cooking in their kitchen or shopping for ingredients at the store.
	  The responsive design preserves the site's visual hierarchy and functionality across all screen sizes, maintaining accessibility and usability.
</p>

<h2>Backend Integration</h2>
